**Title** - Animated Wallpaper/Window
**Repository** - [Include a link to your new public GitHub repository. 
](https://github.com/nxccmmm/animated-wallpaper.git)
**Description** - This will be an animated window screen/wallpaper. This will lead more into the arts-y side of the project, 
                since it will just be displaying images on to the window.
**Features** - Everytime I click on the screen an imported image will pop up in its place and stay until we exit the window. 
                I will try to make it have a max of 5 images on the screen. 
               The window will have the option to quit the screen. The background of the screen will have a smiliar effect to 
               the digital rain just to provide an extra object to the screen. (It will either be heart digital rain or it will 
               be an animated heart image that beats.)
**Outcomes** -
<<<<<<< HEAD
    1. **Ideal Outcome** -  My goal is to make a picture will pop up everytime the mouse clicks anywhere on the parameters of the screen. 
                            Sort of like an animated collage but within a small window screen.
    2. **Minimal Viable Outcome** - If my goal is not a bit too difficult, I want to be able to make an animated window when the images 
                                     will pop up one after the other with the heart background.
**Milestones** My first goal will be to have the window set up and also have the heart background done for the screen. My second goal will 
               be to at least complete half the code to make the images pop up when I click with my mouse within the screen. I will also 
               combine the digital rain/heart background to this window screen where the mouse clicks will happen. The third goal will be to finish and/or 
               fix any imperfections/bugs. By the 2nd week i would have figured out my scope and decide if to continue the main goal of the project, or if
               to make it simpler in order to actually complete the final project.
