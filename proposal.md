**Title** - Animated Wallpaper/Window
**Repository** - [Include a link to your new public GitHub repository.

**Description** - This will be an animated window screen/wallpaper. This will lead more into the arts-y side of the project, since it will just be displaying images on to the window.
**Features** - Everytime I click on the screen an imported image will pop up in its place and stay until we exit the window. I will try to make it have a max of 5 images on the screen. 
               The window will have the option to quit the screen. The background of the screen will have a smiliar effect to the digital rain just to provide an extra object to the screen. 
               (It will either be heart digital rain or it will be an animated heart image that beats.)
**Outcomes** -
    1. **Ideal Outcome** -  My goal is to make a picture will pop up everytime the mouse clicks anywhere on the parameters of the screen. Sort of like an animated collage but within a small window screen.
    2. **Minimal Viable Outcome** - If my goal is not a bit too difficult, I want to be able to make an animated window when the images will pop up one after the other with the heart background.
**Milestones**- I will make the first goal to create the animated background first. The second goal will be to get at least half the code done for the animated clicks. Preferably setting up the window and connecting the background into this 2nd goal. Also including in the second goal, I want to have the images imported already into the files. The third goal is to finish the code and/or be able to fix any imperfections of the code. If worst comes to worst by then i would have figured out if my main idea is not too difficult for me and rework from there.
